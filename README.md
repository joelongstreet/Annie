# Annie

This project is a chrome extension which works with VML's corporate intranet. It allows registered users to download .csv's of filtered employee data by using a combination of the intranet web interface as well as this extension.

[Annie Schmader](http://passport.vml.com/ui/user/aschmader), the *Director of First Impressions* at VML, inspired development of this plugin. One of her many jobs is to verify various types of employee data by cross checking intranet data with human resources data. This extension aims to assist Annie in this task.
